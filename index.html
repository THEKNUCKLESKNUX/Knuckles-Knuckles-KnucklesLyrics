  <p><b>Knuckles from K.N.U.C.K.L.E.S. & Knuckles [Full Version & Knuckles]</b></p>
  
  
 <p>
 Here I Come Roughing Those Knuckles  
The Best Of Them
Tougher Then Knuckles
You Can Call Me Knuckles
Im Like Knuckles
I dont Chuckle
I Rather Flex My Knuckles
Im Hard as Knuckles
It Ain't Hard To Chuckle
I Brake Them Down Rather They Knuckles
Knuckles
Unlike Knuckles
Im independence it is My First Chuckle
First Knuckles
Fill There Knuckles
Stand There Knuckles
Chuckle

[CHORUS]
Born On a Island In The Knuckles
The CUM!
Knuckles
Flows In Side Me
My Doo Doo Flows Inside Me
Streaking... Blood
Cleanse YourSelf
No
I Sure Rock It
I Will Be The One To Set Your Knuckles Free True
I Said Cleanse Your Self With Those Combs Saying I Said you
